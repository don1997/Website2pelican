**Exercise 1.3.**  Define a procedure that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the squares of the two larger numbers.

	::racket
	#lang racket

	(provide sum-of-squares)
	(define (sum-of-squares a b) (+ (* a a) (* b b)))  

	(provide sum-triples)
	(define(sum-triples a b c)
	  (cond
	    ((and (>= a c) (>= b c) (sum-of-squares a b)))
	    ((and (>= b a) (>= c a) (sum-of-squares b c)))
	    ((and (>= c a) (>= a b) (sum-of-squares a c)))))
