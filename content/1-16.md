Summary: My solution to exercise 1.16 in SICP.

**Exercise 1.16.**  Design a procedure that evolves an iterative exponentiation process that uses successive squaring and uses a logarithmic number of steps, as does fast-expt. (Hint: Using the observation that (bn/2)2 = (b2)n/2, keep, along with the exponent n and the base b, an additional state variable a, and define the state transformation in such a way that the product a bn is unchanged from state to state. At the beginning of the process a is taken to be 1, and the answer is given by the value of a at the end of the process. In general, the technique of defining an invariant quantity that remains unchanged from state to state is a powerful way to think about the design of iterative algorithms.)

	(define (fast-exp-iter b n a)
	  (cond ((= n 0) a)
		((even? n)(fast-exp-iter (sqr b) (/ n 2) a))
		(else
		  (fast-exp-iter b ( - n 1) (* a b)))))
